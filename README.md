## 📑 Notes

* If `sales_report.json` is not found, the app will generate **sample data** automatically.
* You can replace `sales_report.json` with your own file, provided it follows the same schema:

  ```json
  {
    "order_id": "ORD100001",
    "order_date": "2024-01-10",
    "product": "Alpha",
    "region": "North",
    "sales_rep": "Asha",
    "quantity": 5,
    "unit_price": 120.0,
    "amount": 600.0
  }
  ```
